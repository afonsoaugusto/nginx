### What is NGINX

nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by [Igor Sysoev](http://sysoev.ru/en/).

### Use Cases

* High performance web server:
  * Used by over 50% of the top 1,000 sites
* Reverse proxy :
  * SSL/TLS Termination
  * Content caching and compression
* Load Balancer

### Proxy vs. Reverse-Proxy

* Proxy:
  * Sits between our clients and the internet
  * Intermediate layer often used within organizations to monitor web traffic
* Reverse proxy :
  * Sits between internet traffic and our servers
  * Intermediate layer often used to load balance traffic & serve content from a cache
